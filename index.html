          <div class="contentText"><p>Super Mario Bros. is a 1985 platform video game initially developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo as a pseudo-sequel to the 1983 game Mario Bros. It was originally released in Japan for the Family Computer on September 13, 1985, later for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1985, Europe on May 15, 1987 and Australia in 1987. It is the first of the Super Mario series of games. In Super Mario Bros., the player controls Mario and in a two-player game, a second player controls Mario's brother Luigi as he travels through the Mushroom Kingdom in order to rescue Princess Toadstool from the antagonist Bowser.

        <p>The game has been highly influential, popularizing the side-scrolling genre. In 2005, IGN's poll named it as The Greatest Game Of All Time. The game also sold enormously well, and was the best-selling game of all time for approximately three decades, until Wii Sports took that title. The commercial success of Super Mario Bros. has caused it to be ported to almost every one of Nintendo's major gaming consoles. Nintendo released special red variants of the Wii and Nintendo DSi XL consoles in re-packaged, Mario-themed, limited edition bundles in late 2010 as part of the 25th anniversary of the game's release.11
