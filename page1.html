<p>In Super Mario Bros., the  character Mario sets off on an adventure to save Princess Toadstool from King Koopa (both later renamed to Princess Peach and Bowser, respectively). Princess Toadstool is capable of reversing the black magic of King Koopa, which explains his motives for kidnapping her. King Koopa uses his magic on the Mushroom Kingdom and transforms the Toads of the land into mushrooms and stones. In the multiplayer mode, the second player will take control of Mario's brother Luigi when the first player loses a life.
</p>
<p>One day, the Mushroom Kingdom was unexpectedly invaded by King Bowser Koopa and his minions. They used their black magic to transform the Toads of the kingdom into bricks and mushrooms, which were scattered throughout the land. Koopa kidnaps Princess Peach and Toadstool. This is very Troubling news that he also Kidnaped Toadstoal becuase he is the only person capable of reversing the effects of the Koopa's black magic, and traps her in his most guarded castle. Far far away, Mario and his brother Luigi, a couple of plumbers, heard about what has happened and immediately set off to save the Mushroom Kingdom. </p>

        <p>Interestingly, the manual states that Mario is "maybe" the hero of the game, indicating that the conclusion of the game is up to the player. If the player manages to travel through each world, thus saving the Mushroom Retainers that were captured in each of the world's castles, then he'll ultimately face Bowser at the end of world eight. Bowser proves to be the most challenging of all the bosses in the game (the rest of them, while similar in appearance, were actually standard enemies dressed up as Bowser), and if Mario manages to bypass him then he'll save the princess, thus ending the game. After completing the game, a second quest becomes available. In the second quest, the game is mostly the same save a few changes.  For example, all Goombas are now Buzzy Beetles.</p><br />
